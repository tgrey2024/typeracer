## User Experience Design

### Project Brief
The project goal is to provide a tool for users to improve their typing speed.

The site user's goals are to:
- Measure and improve their typing speed.
- Know how to take the test.
- Easily take the test.
- Take a test relevant to their ability level.
- Use the test on different devices.
- See accurate results, including their words per minute (WPM).

### Users
Potential users of the site are:

### User Stories
User Stories and the associated Acceptance Criteria and Tasks were generated using Microsoft Copilot. 

The aim is to produce a minimum viable product (MVP) in the 2.5 days given. The AI-generated user stories were reviewed and edited to be SMART and focused for the delivery of an MVP. A Project Board was set up in GitHub Projects to track project progress. The user stories were prioritised using MoSoCoW based of benefits to users and viability.

Here are the user stories that have been prioritised as "must have":

## Deployment
The [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) was used to create the GitHub repository, so that the website could be developed in the correct setup of Gitpod IDE.

The GitHub Copilot extension was also installed in my local client version of MS VS Code, which was also connected with the same GitHub repository and linked to Gitpod via SSH. This allows for AI pair programming in the initial stages of development to create certain sections faster.

The process is as follows:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Go to the [Code Institute Template] (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template).
3. Click **Use this template** and then **Create a new repository**.
4. Enter the repo name and choose to create from template
5. Click **Open** with the Gitpod logo to open the Code Institute IDE workspace.
6. Open VS Code locally and click on Gitpod logo on the left. Click on right arrow next to the workspace you want to work on.
 
Once the MVP has been created in Gitpod, go to GitHub Pages to make an early deployment of the project, so that testing can be done in Dev Tools to highlight key issues that need to be resolve early on in the project.
